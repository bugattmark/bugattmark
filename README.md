# Sup, tl;dr, all u need to know below

### Cool things I've done (quantified impacts on CV):
- with provethat (startup i'm building)'s chatbot + backend -> built an entire AI infra for a travelling agency to help tourists in Thailand book trips and stay safe.
- interend at Deepinvest -> concurrent trade execution engine, port rebalancing engine, invester comps
- interned at Botnoi -> built cool AI agent project, python lib for whisper models inputs, did research into meta learning 
- interned at GoUpscale -> built python lib for preprocessing super dense fin docs, learnt basic SWE lifeskills

### Projects I built (most notable):
- [ML architecture with ViT + temporal transformer to match T1 and fMRI scans in latent space](https://github.com/bugattmark/Structure-Function-Brain)
- [2nd place @ ISA Coding Competition: Black scholes' GBM driven trading simulator with sentiment shocks](https://github.com/bugattmark/Trading-Simulator)
- [ML alpha extraction pipeline from top 100 tickers](https://github.com/bugattmark/Portfolio-ML)
- [Algotrading BTC on AWS for +9.6% growth in wallet]()

### I tinkered with (POC/solves pain point in my life):
- mass web scraping (headless)
- fine tuning models from scratch (lots of ML)
- voice agents from scratch (sagemaker, localized)
- medAI dataset cleaning
- social media bots of all kinds (just for server moderating)
- scripts to make my life better (mostly premade code for housekeeping)

Hackathon project codes (MORE TO COME!!):
- Tomoro.ai's Hackathon(28/9/2025): [InspiredSearch - AI-Powered Research Paper Network: identify paper limitations & research areas FAST](https://github.com/bugattmark/InspiredSearch/)
